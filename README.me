## Description
A personal finance app that aims to provide users with a convenient and efficient way to manage their finances. The app will have both a mobile and web side, with an elegant user interface that enhances the user experience.

Users will be able to register/login to the app - input their income and report their expenses manually or by using Plaid, a financial data platform that connects to users' bank accounts. This feature will enable users to keep track of their income and spending and make informed financial decisions.
